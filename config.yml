  intro:
    text: "With the rapid revolution and increasing availability of geospatial data, not only academia but also industry aspire 
        for solutions to further leverage the big data and AI technologies to create new products, improve efficiencies and 
        provide novel solutions to existing problems. However, despite the widespread interest, there is a lack of communication 
        between the researchers in academia and industry, limiting advancements at the intersection. Academia often has 
        limited access to the rich and potentially useful big geospatial datasets and related real problems. In addition, 
        the solutions proposed by the academic researchers alone are usually developed for small scale with many assumptions, 
        leaving a less-attended gap between methods and their applicability at scale for industrial applications. On the other hand, 
        industry has the data and problems at scale. However, since existing research is often not on par, industry researchers may 
        lean towards using the traditional approaches that are developed without spatial consideration (e.g., ignoring spatial and 
        temporal dependencies), and project teams have limited time and efforts to dive deep on the development of novel techniques 
        that can be high-risk but high-potential. This opens up opportunities for synergistic collaboration between industrial 
        practitioners and academic researchers. The 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Spatial Big Data and AI for Industrial 
        Applications (GeoIndustry 2022) is to offer a forum to exchange thoughts and ideas between industry and academia and reduce the 
        siloed efforts. At the same time, the collaborations, via invited and regular talks, can not only accelerate the research-to-impact 
        cycle, but also foster workforce development for future geospatial researchers. "

      title: "Valuing Personal Location Data (Keynote Talk)" 
      abstract: "The whereabouts of regular people from their everyday lives is valuable, both to the people 
      themselves and to organizations that want to learn more about them. And yet the precise value of this 
      data is difficult to pinpoint, both in the minds of the data subjects and the accounting of the data 
      collectors. From the subject’s point of view, is differential privacy the answer? What would motivate 
      a subject to release their data? What if they want to release just a vague idea of their location? From 
      the data collector’s point of view, how can they put a price on location data and decide which data 
      to buy? How do they know when they have enough? This talk will explore these questions, highlighting 
      some of our lab’s research toward clarifying how to protect and value everyday location data."

      title: "Geospatial research questions - simple observations and solutions (Keynote Talk)" 
      abstract: "Why is spatial special? One answer could be that interesting geospatial research is guided by our 
      experiences in the physical world. This talk will look at three cases from my personal research trajectory that were 
      triggered by interesting observations and hopefully resulted in meaningful insights. The first case relates to the 
      emergence of GPS devices and how this technology allowed us to record activities. We will discuss research for 
      extracting knowledge from collected spatiotemporal data, e.g., map construction algorithms, as well as open problems. 
      The second case looks at crowdsourcing and engaging internet users in (geospatial) data generation. Crowdsourcing had 
      a profound impact on the geospatial world and we will look at geocoded image data and what it can tell us about places. 
      The third case relates to scenarios in which a lot of data is actually not enough and how modeling and simulation can 
      be used as a complement. The talk concludes with discussing important research challenges in data-poor scenarios, such 
      as data privacy & crowdsourcing and indoor environments."
